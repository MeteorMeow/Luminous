            <p>
                LuminoLens is a range of affordable, scientifically verified blue light filtering glasses designed for students, professionals, coders, and designers who spend long hours in front of digital screens.

            <h2>2. What problem does it solve?</h2>
            <p>
                Prolonged screen use often causes digital eye strain, headaches, and disturbed sleep due to exposure to blue light. LuminoLens helps reduce these effects with certified blue light filters while offering guidance on healthy screen habits.
