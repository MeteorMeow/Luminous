        <h1>About LuminoLens</h1>

        <p>At LuminoLens, we're on a mission to protect the eyes of a digital generation. In a world where screens dominate our lives — from study sessions to design projects, coding marathons to late-night scrolls — we've created a solution that's smart, affordable, and empowering.</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <p>LuminoLens was born from a growing concern: digital eye strain. Students and professionals today spend 8 to 12 hours daily on screens, leading to headaches, fatigue, dry eyes, and disrupted sleep. Most blue light glasses on the market are either expensive or unverified, with no scientific backing or user guidance.</p>

        <p>We decided to change that. Backed by optical research, LuminoLens offers certified blue light filtering glasses tailored for students, coders, designers, and digital professionals — all at student-friendly prices.</p>

        <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>

        <p>Each LuminoLens purchase includes access to a microsite via QR code. This microsite features daily eye exercises, ergonomic tips, and transparent spectrometer test reports for lens certification. We combine reliable protection with easy-to-understand education, making eye care accessible and actionable.</p>

        <p>Our frames are lightweight, minimalist, and designed for long hours of comfortable use — whether you're gaming, working, or preparing for exams.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>

        <p>We're committed to long-term digital well-being. Our future plans include expanding into UV-protection sunglasses, ergonomic desk tools, and AR/VR-compatible eye wellness solutions. We also aim to collaborate with schools and coaching centers to distribute affordable student wellness kits at scale.</p>

        <h2>Join the Mission</h2>

        <p>LuminoLens is more than just eyewear — it's a movement toward healthier screen time. We're here to protect your eyes, support your productivity, and power your day with clarity and care.</p>
